<h1>Hello👋 I'm Vivek G 👀</h1>

#### I am half developer, half designer and everything tech in between!

My [website](https://yakshag.github.io/) should give you a well rounded picture, but who cares, right?

# Developer me
I make stuff work, even if I am not doing it in the best possible way 🤷‍♂️

## 1. [Google Meet ⇔ Slack integration](https://github.com/yakshaG/gmeet-slack-extension)

Google Meet ⇔ Slack automatically updates your slack status, when you join and exit meetings, even for unscheduled meetings or overflowing meetings.

## 2. [Lizen](https://github.com/yakshaG/lizen)
List(z)en to articles — just like a podcast!

## 3. [Hugo static site generation template](https://github.com/yakshaG/hugo-ejnana)
